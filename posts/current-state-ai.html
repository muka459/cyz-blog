                    The idea that AI will take over software engineering jobs is wildly exaggerated. We are witnessing a
                    revolution.
                    To quote Steve Jobs: “Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes
                    everything.”
                    The revolutionary product today is AI.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Throughout history, major technological advancements have sparked fears of widespread job losses,
                    only to ultimately create far more opportunities than they displaced. These innovations transformed
                    industries,
                    boosted productivity, and gave rise to entirely new sectors. Here are some standout examples:
                </p>

                <h2>The Computer</h2>
                <p>
                    In the 1940s and '50s, as computers like the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC)
                    emerged,
                    clerical workers—typists, accountants, and human “calculators”—feared replacement. Predictions of
                    mass unemployment spread.
                    And what happened? Computers revolutionized every industry.
                    Entirely new professions emerged—programmers, IT specialists, software developers, and data
                    analysts.
                    Today, the tech sector employs millions directly and supports countless more jobs in e-commerce,
                    digital media, and beyond.
                    You can find an IT job in virtually any industry.
                </p>

                <h2>The Internet</h2>
                <p>
                    When the internet rose to prominence, traditional media (newspapers, TV), retail workers, and travel
                    agents worried.
                    Pundits predicted the collapse of brick-and-mortar businesses and massive job losses.
                    But rather than destroying jobs, the internet gave birth to a thriving digital economy.
                    Web developers, digital marketers, influencers, app developers, and logistics workers all emerged.
                    E-commerce alone supports over 2 million jobs in the U.S. today, and traditional industries have
                    adapted rather than disappeared.
                </p>

                <h2>We Are Still Early...</h2>
                <p>
                    As of March 2025, AI is evolving at an unprecedented pace, rapidly integrating into daily life.
                    In my current role at a car manufacturer, I have never seen a technology adopted so quickly.
                    The efficiency gains in daily work are tangible—often by multiple factors.
                    Models like Claude Sonnet, GPT-4o, and DeepSeek are pushing the boundaries of natural language
                    processing,
                    reasoning, and task automation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A clear example: My business department can now write scripts and analyze data in seconds or
                    minutes—
                    tasks that previously required significant time or external support.
                    Yet, the old refrain of “machines taking our jobs” is louder than ever.
                    From my perspective, this fear is completely misplaced—just as it was in the past.
                    AI isn’t a replacement; it’s an amplifier.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is already creating new job opportunities, such as autonomous vehicle maintenance and synthetic
                    media production,
                    including within the film industry. The global AI market is projected to reach $1.8 trillion by
                    2030—
                    someone has to build, maintain, and innovate in that space.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fear of AI stems from a zero-sum mindset—the belief that there is a fixed amount of work to be done.
                    But history tells a different story. The steam engine, computers, and the internet didn’t reduce the
                    amount of work;
                    they expanded it exponentially. AI is doing the same.
                    It’s not here to take jobs—it’s here to hand you a shovel for digging into a goldmine of
                    possibilities.
                    The key, as always, is to pick up the shovel.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And remember, we are still early...
