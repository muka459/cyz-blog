                    The idea that AI will take over software engineer jobs is wild. We are literally withnessing
                    a revolution. To quote jobs here: Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that
                    changes everything"
                    Obviously the revolutionary product here is AI.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Throughout history, there have been numerous inventions and revolutions that initially sparked fears
                    of widespread job loss,
                    only to ultimately create far more opportunities than they displaced.. These innovations often
                    transformed industries,
                    boosted productivity, and spawned entirely new sectors. Here are some standout examples:
                </p>

                <h2>The Computer</h2>
                <p>
                    In the 1940s and '50s, as computers like Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC)
                    emerged, clerical workers—typists,
                    accountants, human “calculators”—feared replacement. Predictions of mass unemployment abounded..
                    And what happened? Computers revolutionized every industry. Programmers, IT specialists, software
                    developers, and data analysts became new career paths.
                    The tech sector now employs millions directly and supports countless more jobs in e-commerce,
                    digital media, and beyond. You can literally find a IT job in any industry branch...
                </p>

                <h2>The Internet</h2>
                <p>
                    With the rise of the internet traditional media (newspapers, TV), retail workers, and travel agents
                    worried. Pundits predicted brick-and-mortar collapse and job evaporation.
                    Far from destroying jobs, the internet created a digital economy. Web developers, digital marketers,
                    influencers, app developers, and logistics workers emerged.
                    E-commerce alone supports over 2 million U.S. jobs today, while traditional sectors adapted rather
                    than vanished...

                    The current state of AI in March 2025 is a fascinating blend of rapid, fast advancement and growing
                    integration into daily life. For example, within my current job at a car manufacturer, I have never
                    seen
                    a technology being adopted so fast, where literally can see efficienty boost in daily work by
                    mutliple factors.
                    Models like Claude Sonnet, GPT 4o, Deepseek etc. push boundaries in natural language, reasoning, and
                    task automation... Again an example: My business department can now write scripts and perform data
                    analyses within a few seconds/minutes. In the past, this was much more time-consuming work or you
                    needed support.
                    The old refrain of “machines taking our jobs” is back, louder than ever. From my point of view this
                    fear is totaly misplaced—just as in the past.. AI isn’t a replacement, it’s an amplifier.
                    It will and already creates many jobs such as autonomous vehicle maintenance, synthetic media
                    production (also within film indutry)... global AI market’s projected to hit $1.8 trillion by
                    2030—someone’s got to build, run, and innovate that...
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fear of AI stems from a zero-sum mindset—assuming there’s a fixed pile of work to be done.
                    But the steam engine, computer, and internet didn’t shrink the pile; they made it explode.
                    AI is doing the same. It’s not here to steal our jobs—it’s here to hand you a shovel for digging
                    into a goldmine of possibilities.. The trick, as always, is to grab the shovel.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And remember, we are still early...
